# Detection-of-Most-Influential-Nodes-in-a-Social-Network

This repository contains a model for Detection of Most Influential Nodes in a Social Network.

This is a novel approach inspired by the latest works in the domain. To find the most Influential Nodes in a Social Network the approach first makes use of communities. Firstly the graph is divided into a set of communities. Then 3 different factors are used to rank the nodes in the graph and detemine each nodes' influence power. Finally TOP - K nodes are selected from each community of the graph in the ratio of size of the community.

The results are then compared with all the standard models and judged on the metric Final Infected Scale. This scale is calculated using the Susceptible - Infected - Recovery(SIR) Model. 

The model is judged on 7 datasets and final results are plotted on a FTC VS Spreader Fraction graph and compared with 6 different standard models.
